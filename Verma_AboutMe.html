                    <p>	Hello, my name is Rhea Verma. I am a student in Dublin High School. I am currently taking a Computer Science Principle course. My interest in computer science began in the summer of 2018, as a soon-to-be freshman. I have always seen my mom code and I was very curious about what she actually did in her job and how it actually benefited everyday life. I also had a will to learn new languages. Since then, I had an aim to learn computer languages and become a professional software developer in the future by taking courses inside and outside the vicinity of school.</p>
                    <p>Ever since I was 5, I have always had an interest in many languages. I started off by trying to learn Russian and Thai at the age of 8, but I took on a challenge that was too big for me to take on, considering that Thai is one of the hardest languages out in the world. Even though I eventually gave up on learning those languages, I figured out a way to learn other languages. I actually took the time to focus on one language. At the age of 10, I gave Korean a try. I surprisingly picked up how to read in a short amount of time and not taking that long for me to start writing. I also picked up many words and sentences when I watched Korean Soap Operas and listened to Korean music. Even though I had just learned a new language, I was still not satisfied. I then took courses of Spanish that my middle school and high school were offering. I was determined to learn as many languages as I could, not minding if they were verbal or computer languages.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my experiences in working with code during my time in Computer Science Principles, I have noticed that patience, communication, and efficiency are all essential skills to have. The first website I ever contributed to developing was a project was a scratch project and app inventor project I had to do in a Computer Science course in 2018. As it was my first experience with code, I did not know what I was supposed to be doing or know if I even had any skills to find out the solutions to my problems. To resolve this, I took the help of my peers and outside resources like the internet. In this way, problem solving, along with communication, was pivotal in figuring out the commands that would be used to make our game function properly.</p>
                    <p>All things considered, I have yet to learn many practices of computer science and engineering, whether it be learning how to code in many different languages or just simply understanding the concepts connected to it.</p>
