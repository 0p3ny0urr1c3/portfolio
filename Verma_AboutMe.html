                    <p>My name is Rhea Verma. I am currently a Freshman in Dublin High School in California. My interest in computer science began in the fall of 2018, as a soon-to-be freshman. I had always seen my mom code and I was very curious about what she actually did in her job. Since then, I have been working towards using my problem solving skills to develop code in order to solve problems or complete tasks that are important and useful to me. I aim to be a professional software developer in the future by taking part in activities, clubs, and other events that I can use and learn programming with peers who share similar interests as I do. The reason why I have such an affinity for programming and learning about digital networks is because I am able to apply both my logical and creative thinking into developing code and implementing it into situations where I am solving a practical problem, or simply entertaining my imagination.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my experiences in working with code and developing web apps, I have noticed that collaboration, patience, and persistence are all essential skills to have. The first website I ever contributed to developing was a project was a scratch project and app inventor project I had to do in a Computer Science course in 2018. I learned that cooperation and discussion was important for us to progress with any ideas that we had and how to further develop them into something tangible and practical in regards to real-world problems. As it was my first experience with code, there were many instances in which I felt confused and did not know what I was supposed to be doing. To overcome this, I took the help of the internet to research what my problem was and how to solve. In this way, patience, along with persistence, was crucial in developing the code that would be used in our final product.</p>
                    <p>Everything considered, I have yet to gain many skills from my experiences with computer science and engineering- whether it be learning programming from an expert or taking the courses in school, that I continue to use in everything that I do. Thank you for your time, please feel free to explore the rest of my portfolio.</p>
