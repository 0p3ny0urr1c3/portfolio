          <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
           <h4>Taco Season</h4>
         <p>The App Inventor project was another project I was assigned in 
         Science Principles. In this project, we had to use the Massachusetts 
         Institute of Technology App Inventor software to create an app. My 
         partner, Katelyn Zhao, and I had created an app called Photo Booth. The
         purpose of the app was for the user to take a picture and alter it in 
         their own way, using the drawing or rotate feature. During the process 
         of creating our app, we had many features we wanted to include in our 
         app to make the app more productive. At first, we were only able to 
         figure out how to add a feature that deletes pictures, so the majority 
         of feedback from others recommended us to add more elements to the app. 
         As a result, we were able to add elements like the drawing feature, 
         rotate and save buttons, and etc. These were features that were not 
         included from the initial tutorial we followed to create the basic 
         structure of our app. We certainly created an app that we would not have
         imagined to create as a novices in coding, surpassing our expectations.</p>

      <strong>Project</strong>
        <h3>App Inventor Project</h3>
        <h4>Photobooth App</h4>
      <p>As our first project in my Computer Science course, we were assigned the
      Scratch project. In this project, we had to use a website named Scratch to 
      make a game. My partner, Jonathan Wei, and I had created a game called Taco 
      Season. We used brainstorming to come up with many possible game ideas we 
      could come up with. We had to determine which ideas were approachable, 
      meaning if it was a fun game idea and not to hard but still challenging to 
      make. The objective of the game was to complete all the obstacles in each 
      course to progress to the next level, until you have finished all three 
      levels. My role in this project was to develop the code using the blocks in 
      Scratch. What really helped the team dynamic was that my partner and I 
      communicated and shared ideas on a constant basis. We kept each other 
      updated on each of our ideas, telling each other if we came up with more 
      suggestions to improve the game or solutions to the problems we encountered.</p>

         <strong>Project</strong>
          <h3>Image Manipulation</h3>
           <h4>Kyut : Framing and Design</h4>
         <p>What helped the team dynamic was when my partner, Katelyn Zhao, and I
         were constantly coming up with new ideas and improvements we could make 
         which helped us on our code as well as our team dynamic since the both 
         of us were communicating and sharing ideas. We also had our own strengths
         and weaknesses that was useful for helping each other and collaborating. 
         While we did come up with many ideas, we did not immediately act up on 
         it and develop code right away. When we faced a lot of problems where 
         we kept on getting errors or could not figure out how to even start 
         making our code interactive, we slowly started procrastinating and not 
         work enough on the project during the weekends. This would have been 
         prevented if we had managed our time better and ask each other about 
         our schedules to work around the time either of us get busy. Then we 
         were conscious about the time we had left and started working even 
         harder that we already had been to finish the project in time. All in 
         all, we successfully created a product that is operating properly, and 
         even though we got a bit sidetracked, we can assure that we went beyond 
         our abilities and capabilities to finish our project without any errors.</P>

      <strong>Project</strong>
        <h3>Hangman Project</h3>
        <h4>Photobooth App</h4>
      <p>The creative process my partner and I used in the Hangman project was 
      different than the process we used in Text Adventure Project, another 
      project I did with my partner Alina Lee. This time we excluded the use of 
      a flowchart. Instead we brainstormed ideas together and then did our work 
      separately. We worked on two different files, combining our code together 
      in the end and correcting little mistakes we encountered on the way of 
      developing our code. Communication was helpful when working on our project, 
      to check in on each other about how each of us was doing and if either of 
      needed help. Reflecting on the team dynamic, communication and collaboration 
      helped the team work well together like always since it allows us to help 
      each other and work with each other to solve problems we face. This was 
      better than the Text Adventure Project because we now had a little bit more 
      experience in Python and got the hang of developing some of the code, than 
      the time we made the Text Adventure Project, since we have not had the 
      chance to create something using Python.
