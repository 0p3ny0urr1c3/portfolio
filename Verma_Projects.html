          <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
           <h4>Taco Season</h4>
         <p>The App Inventor project was another project I was assigned in Computer Science Principles. In this project, we had to use the Massachusetts Institute of Technology App Inventor software to create an app. My partner, Katelyn Zhao, and I had created an app called Photo Booth. The purpose of the app was for the user to take a picture and alter it in their own way, using the drawing or rotate feature. During the process of creating our app, we had many features we wanted to include in our app to make the app more productive. At first, we were only able to figure out how to add a feature that deletes pictures, so the majority of feedback from others recommended us to add more elements to the app. As a result, we were able to add elements like the drawing feature, rotate and save buttons, and etc. These were features that weren’t included from the initial tutorial we followed to create the basic structure of our app. We certainly created an app that we wouldn’t have imagined to create as a novices in coding, surpassing our expectations.</p>

      <strong>Project</strong>
        <h3>App Inventor Project</h3>
        <h4>Photobooth App</h4>
      <p>As our first project in my Computer Science course, we were assigned the Scratch project. In this project, we had to use a website named Scratch to make a game. My partner, Jonathan Wei, and I had created a game called Taco Season.We used brainstorming to come up with many possible game ideas we could come up with. We had to determine which ideas were approachable, meaning if it was a fun game idea and not to hard but still challenging to make. The objective of the game was to complete all the obstacles in each course to progress to the next level, until you have finished all three levels. My role in this project was to develop the code using the blocks in Scratch. What really helped the team dynamic was that my partner and I communicated and shared ideas on a constant basis. We kept each other updated on each of our ideas, telling each other if we came up with more suggestions to improve the game or solutions to the problems we encountered.</p>
